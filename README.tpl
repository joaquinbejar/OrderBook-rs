```

### 🧪 Test & Quality

```sh
make test          # Run all tests
make fmt           # Format code
make fmt-check     # Check formatting without applying
make lint          # Run clippy with warnings as errors
make lint-fix      # Auto-fix lint issues
make fix           # Auto-fix Rust compiler suggestions
make check         # Run fmt-check + lint + test
```

### 📦 Packaging & Docs

make coverage-html       # Generate HTML coverage report
make open-coverage       # Open HTML report
make bench               # Run benchmarks using Criterion
make bench-show          # Open benchmark report
make bench-save          # Save benchmark history snapshot
make bench-compare       # Compare benchmark runs
make bench-json          # Output benchmarks in JSON
make bench-clean         # Remove benchmark data
```

### 🧪 Git & Workflow Helpers

```sh
make git-log             # Show commits on current branch vs main
make check-spanish       # Check for Spanish words in code
make zip                 # Create zip without target/ and temp files
make tree                # Visualize project tree (excludes common clutter)
```

### 🤖 GitHub Actions (via act)

```sh
make workflow-build      # Simulate build workflow
make workflow-lint       # Simulate lint workflow
make workflow-test       # Simulate test workflow
make workflow-coverage   # Simulate coverage workflow
make workflow            # Run all workflows
```

ℹ️ Requires act for local workflow simulation and cargo-tarpaulin for coverage.
